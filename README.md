# USA-Crime-Data-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS PowerBi)
## Project Objective
Crime analysis is one of the most important activities that intelligence and law enforcement organizations perform all over the world. In this project, I will analyze data that has been collected about crimes that happened in different parts of the US in 1980 to 2014. The dataset consists of all related data about a crime such as where it happened, the important dates of the event, and how is it co-related to other events. Most law and enforcement agencies face the challenge of efficiently and accurately analyzing the growing volume of crime-related data. 
## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/Chamara1998/Power_Bi-Dash_Boards/blob/main/Project%203%20-%20US%20Crime%20Dataset%20(Orginal).xlsb">Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)
- What are the trends in the progression of crimes in certain areas? 
- What age groups are mostly involved in these incidents? 
- What weapons are used in various crimes? 
- What measures can law enforcement agencies take to reduce crime?

## Project Insight
- The general decrease in crime over this period indicates a positive impact of crime prevention measures. This trend suggests that policies and interventions implemented during these years were effective in reducing crime rates.
- Males are predominantly involved as both perpetrators (62.58%) and victims (77.39%). This highlights a significant gender disparity in crime involvement.
- Murder or manslaughter (98.57%) is significantly more common than manslaughter by negligence (1.43%). This indicates a higher prevalence of intentional violent crimes.
- The highest crime rates are among individuals aged 17-24 (33.94%). This age group is particularly vulnerable to engaging in criminal activities.
- Most victims are in the 30-36 age group (26.25%). This demographic is significantly affected by crimes.
- Continued investment in crime prevention programs, along with periodic evaluation and adaptation of these programs, is essential to sustain and further this downward trend.
- The considerable number of unsolved crimes (190K) highlights a gap in the criminal justice system.
- Detailed analysis of weapon usage trends over different years "reveals" which weapons are most commonly used in crimes.
- Identifying geographical hotspots for crimes involving weapons helps in resource allocation.
- The consistent number of crimes across months suggests that crime is not significantly influenced by seasonal factors. This consistency implies that crime prevention efforts need to be year-round.

## Final Conclusion:
- The journey through crime data analysis has been insightful, revealing significant trends and informing actionable recommendations. This reflection essay not only document my progress, but it also emphasizes the necessity of data-driven decision-making in crime prevention and policy development. The visualizations were critical in revealing patterns and trends, and stakeholder input was crucial in structuring the findings. Overall, this research has been a fantastic learning experience, helping me improve my analytical abilities and provide insights into the complicated dynamics of crime data.
